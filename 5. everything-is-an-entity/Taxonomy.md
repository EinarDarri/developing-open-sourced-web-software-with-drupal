In Drupal, **taxonomy** is the system for describing and reusing classifications across your site. It comes in two parts. A **vocabulary** is the configuration that defines a particular classification scheme—“Topics,” “Regions,” “Audiences,” “Tags.” A vocabulary says, in effect, “here is a controlled list you can reference,” and it holds settings such as whether the list is hierarchical or flat, and whether you’ll allow free tagging. The actual items in that list are **terms**. A taxonomy **term** is a content entity (`taxonomy_term`) that represents one category—say, “Music,” “Europe,” or “Parents.” Terms live inside exactly one vocabulary; they can be nested (parent–child relationships) to form trees; and, like other entities, they can have fields, translations, and their own canonical pages. Vocabularies are configuration entities (`taxonomy.vocabulary.*`) that define the existence and behavior of the classification; terms are the data you create within that configuration.

Taxonomy matters because it gives you a shared language you can attach to many different things. You add a **term reference field** to a content type (or to users, media, blocks, etc.), and editors pick one or more terms when creating content. Those assignments unlock powerful behaviors: consistent labeling for navigation, filters and facets in Views or search, rule targets in personalization, and audience/region-driven display logic. Since the same vocabulary can be reused across multiple bundles and entity types, taxonomy becomes the cross-cutting glue that keeps disparate content aligned without duplicating lists in many places. Terms themselves can carry additional meaning through fields—icons, colors, SEO text, lead images, external IDs—which then inform how category landing pages and menus render.

Because taxonomy terms are entities, they have URLs, can be displayed with View modes, and can be themed; yet they are intentionally lighter-weight than nodes. That distinction leads to a common modeling question: **when should something be a taxonomy (terms) and when should it be a content type (nodes)?** Choose taxonomy when you need a **reusable classification label** with optional metadata, often applied to many items, and when editorial workflow is minimal: think categories, tags, audiences, product attributes, or regions. Choose a **content type** when the item is a **first-class piece of content** that merits its own full page, richer fields, complex layouts, moderation states, and revision history—an “Event,” “Article,” or “Attraction.” If you find yourself wanting long bodies, complex media galleries, or granular publishing permissions on a “category,” that’s a sign it probably wants to be a node (with a term reference tying it into the taxonomy), or a hybrid: a node type for the landing page plus a vocabulary for organizing the items beneath it.

In short, a **vocabulary** is the blueprint that defines a classification scheme; **terms** are the structured, fieldable entities that realize that scheme. We use taxonomies to label and relate content consistently across the site, enabling filtering, navigation, and rules. We use content types when the thing itself is content that deserves a full editorial and display life of its own. The two work best together: nodes carry the story; taxonomy supplies the shared categories that make the story discoverable and coherent.

## Taxonomies in Drupal CMS
After installation of Drupal CMS, it creates one vocabulary: Tags and has one term in it: Drupal.
