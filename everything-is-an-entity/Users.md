In Drupal, a **user** is both a real person who visits your site and a first-class **content entity** that represents that person’s account. The entity—the `user`—stores identity and state: a unique ID (`uid`), username, email, password hash (or external auth mapping), status (active/blocked), time stamps, and ownership links (“authored by” on nodes and comments). Like other entities, users are **fieldable and translatable**, so you can attach structured data (department, avatar, bio, newsletter consent) to support richer “profile” needs. Core gives you one bundle for the user entity; if you need multiple profile types, the contributed _Profile_ module adds dedicated profile bundles while the user entity remains the login identity.

The “physical” person interacts with the site through **authentication** and **sessions**. Authentication may be local (username/password) or delegated (OAuth/OIDC, SAML, LDAP), but in all cases the result is a logged-in account represented by a `user` entity. Drupal also recognizes people without accounts: the **anonymous user** (internally `uid` 0) exists for visitors who aren’t signed in. The moment a visitor logs in, they become the **authenticated user** (a special role granted to all accounts), and Drupal associates their actions—creating content, posting comments, saving preferences—with their user entity.

What a user can do is governed by Drupal’s **access system**, which is role- and permission-driven. **Roles** are configuration that group **permissions** (strings like “create Article content,” “administer users,” “access content”). Users are assigned one or more roles; access checks throughout Drupal—routing, forms, entity operations, fields—ask “does this account have a role with the required permission?” Beyond these global permissions, Drupal applies **entity access handlers** (e.g., “view/update/delete this specific node?”), **node access grants** for per-item visibility, and optional **field-level access** (via contrib) for finer control. Editorial governance can layer on top: **Content Moderation** restricts who may move content between states, while **Workflows** and revision permissions manage who can create, revert, or approve changes. The net effect is a consistent cascade: permissions via roles set the broad envelope, entity/field access tailor it per item, and workflow rules constrain publishing power.

Because the user is an entity, it participates in everything Drupal does with content: you can reference users from other entities (authors, reviewers, owners), render users with **view modes** (public profile vs. compact byline), expose user fields to search and Views, and export account configuration as part of your deployable config. Meanwhile, the human reality—onboarding, blocking, password resets, two-factor auth, consent, and SSO—maps cleanly onto that entity. In practice, think of the **user entity** as the durable record of identity and authorization, and the **person** as the actor who authenticates to that record. Roles, permissions, and access handlers connect the two: they translate human intent (“this editor may publish News”) into enforceable rules the system applies everywhere.
